-   Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
-   In the application, click the key icon in the top left to enter and save your key. It will be stored securely in your browser's `localStorage`.

### 2. Via an Environment Variable

-   Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the project.
-   Add your API key as follows:
    ```
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
-   Restart the development server if it was running.

The application will prioritize the key set in the environment variables.
